# sysreptor_utilities
The scripts in this repository are intended to make life easier for users of the pentesting reporting tool Sysreptor. While the development team at Syslifters provides a CLI tool called [`reptor`](https://github.com/Syslifters/reptor) for managing instances, for an individual or small teams there are some basic bulk functions that are simpler to do with scripts.

Please note that these scripts are not meant to replace the full functionality of [`reptor`](https://github.com/Syslifters/reptor) and do not provide the same features. Crucially, the script for bulk exporting projects does not perform any sort of encryption, and so it should not be treated as a substitute for the official backup feature. If exported project files include customer information, other tools will be required to make the information secure. 

Disclaimer: These scripts are in no way affiliated with the company Syslifters GmbH or the Sysreptor project.
